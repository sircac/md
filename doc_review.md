Dear Paolo,  
  
since DU 39 has priority I would like to help ensuring that we don't have any hiccups in the procedures and see how/if I can help in preparing.  
  
To my understanding you still need to take data for the following:  
  
1) HV tuning (as the replacement DOM needs to be tuned) -> 15 x 8 minutes L0 data = 120 minutes)  
2) laser runs (time calibration) -> 10 minutes L0 & 10 minutes L1 = 20 minutes  
3) nanobeacon runs -> 30 x 3 minutes L0 data = 90 minutes  
4) compass check -> included in any run  
5) piezo check -> included in any run >5min with acoustic emitters on  
  
Please note that we will need L0 data for the HV tuning (for DU 38 we have only L1 data, which provides far too little statistics and in addition a bias), we will adjust the descriptions accordingly.  
  
Let me know if I can help with anything.  
  
cheers,  
Dorothea
